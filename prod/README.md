This `prod` folder works as our "Server"

On your machine navigate to /prod and type `docker-compose up` in your terminal to start the "server" with all components.
Maybe a second restart (after some time) is necessary for initialising the test-application. 
Consider watching the logs if the application was started successfully or something is missing, 
e.g. path to docker-compose (commonly on windows)
